    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
        </li>
        <li>
            salt and ground black pepper to taste
        </li>
        <li>
            Â¼ cup rice vinegar
        </li> 
        <li>
            2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
        </li>
        <li>
            1 tablespoon honey
        </li>
        <li>
            1 tablespoon lime juice
        </li>
        <li>
            1 teaspoon red pepper flakes
        </li>
        <li>
            1 small head lettuce leaves, or to taste
        </li>
        <li>
            2 large flour tortillas
        </li>
        <li>
            3 carrots, peeled and cut into matchsticks
        </li>
        <li>
            1 roasted red bell pepper, sliced
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Place chicken between 2 sheets of plastic wrap on a solid, level surface covered with a towel to minimize noise. Pound chicken flat using the smooth side of a meat mallet.    
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat a grill pan to medium-high heat.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place chicken on the hot grill pan; season lightly with salt and pepper. Cook, covered, for 5 minutes. Flip and cook until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 3 to 5 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
        </li>
        <li>
            Stir rice vinegar, cilantro, honey, lime juice, and red pepper flakes together in a bowl to make the dressing.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place chicken on a cutting board and chop into strips. Toss into the dressing.
        </li>
        <li>
            Lay a bed of lettuce onto each tortilla; add carrots and roasted red bell pepper. Top with chicken strips; drizzle lettuce with remaining dressing. Wrap tortilla around the filling. Repeat with remaining tortilla.
        </li>
    </ol>
